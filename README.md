# microarray-analysis


The purpose of this project is the initial experience in bioinformatics data analysis. The dataset used in this project is Microarray data related to blood cancer (leukemia) which can be found in 
(this)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48558] link.

First, I normalized data and then used dimensionality reduction so that the effect of the genes whose expression level is approximately same get reduced.
After that, the correlations between gene expressions are observed and 
Then compare the level of expression of genes in the healthy group with the level of expression of genes in sick people.

Ù‘Finally, 
For each category of genes that increase or decrease expression in sick people, I analyse the pathway abd gene ontology.
